Question 4a (written section)
•	The Balance factor of each node has to be <= 1
•	A balanced BST is self balancing after every operation that alters the tree
•	Every parent/node can have at most 2 children
•	The root value is greater than both children
•	Left subtree of each nodes is less than the node values
•	Right subtree of each node is greater than the node values

Question 4b (written section)
    n = height of the tree
i.	Insert: O(logn)
ii.	Delete: O(logn)
iii.    Find-next: O(logn)
iv.	Find-prev: O(logn)
v.	Find-min: O(logn)
vi.	Find-max: O(logn)

Question 5b (written section)
•	I didn't run into problem's but some that my arise is that the recursive call/stack
    might get too large when finding the right place to insert a value which will take a
    long time insert an item. We are also using extra implicit space which isn't good if we
    use this in industry with huge amount of nodes.
